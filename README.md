### 🛑 THE PROBLEM
**EXAMS ARE THE CRUTCH OF THE INARTICULATE STUDENT.**
*   PYQs scattered across 10+ WhatsApp groups.
*   Zero organization by subject or semester.
*   Wasting hours just *finding* what to study.

### ⚡ THE SOLUTION
**SANKALAN.** A structured, AI-powered ecosystem designed to replace last-minute panic with raw efficiency. No ads. No tracking. Just pure utility.
